BLE BASED SMART CONTACT TRACING

OVERVIEW:
This project aims to develop an Android mobile application that utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals to automatically detect the proximity distance between individuals and classify them as high risk and low risk contacts using machine learning classifiers. The application connects users with essential health services by ensuring proper social distancing through BLE signals generated and received by nearby mobile devices. Users of the application will receive popup notifications informing them of the risks associated with their proximity to others.
Additionally, the application implements contact tracing functionality by storing logs of users who have tested positive for COVID-19. These logs are used to inform individuals who were in close contact with affected users, prompting them to self-quarantine.

FEATURES:
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal-based proximity detection
